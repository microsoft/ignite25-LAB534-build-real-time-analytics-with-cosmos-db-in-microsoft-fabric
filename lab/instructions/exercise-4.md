# Implement Reverse ETL and Build Personalization Model
In this exercise, you will create a Dataflow Gen2 to extract and transform data from the Eventhouse, update the user profiles in Cosmos DB, and then use that data to build a personalization model in a notebook.

by the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:
- Create a Dataflow Gen2 to extract and transform data
- Perform Reverse ETL to update user profiles in Cosmos DB
- Build a personalization model in a Fabric notebook

## Create Data Warehouse Views
1. In your Fabric workspace, navigate to the Data Warehouse where you want to create views.
1. Create a new SQL query by selecting the **New SQL Query** button in the warehouse page.

1. In the query window editor, paste the following SQL code to create views in the warehouse:

+++*CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimCustomerKey AS
SELECT CustomerId, CustomerKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimCustomer;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimShopKey AS
SELECT ShopId, ShopKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimShop;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimMenuItemKey AS
SELECT MenuItemId, MenuItemKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimMenuItem;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vFactSalesMaxKey AS
SELECT
  MaxSalesKey = COALESCE(MAX(SalesKey), 0),
  ExistingTxnCount = COUNT(*)
FROM dbo.FactSales;*+++

1. Select **Run** to execute the query and create the views in the warehouse.

## Create Dataflow Gen2

1. Browse to the Fabric workspace you created in the previous steps by selecting it from the left navigation pane if it is already open, or selecting **Workspaces** on the left navigation pane and then selecting it.

1. From the top menu ribbon, select **+ New item**, a pane will open on the right side and on the filter text box on the top right of the pane, type +++*dataflow*+++ to filter the list of items. Select **Dataflow Gen2**.

1. In the Merge pane, select +++*vDimCustomerKey*+++ as the second table to merge with.
1. Select the +++*CustomerId*+++ column from both tables by double clicking on the column names.
1. Verify that the Join kind is set to **Left outer (all from first, matching from second)** and select **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> At this stage you may recieve a warning message about data privacy levels before you can resume any transformations. You can safely select continue and check "Ignore privacy level check for this document" and select **Save** for the purposes of this lab.

1. In the new merged transformation, select the expand icon next to the **vDimCustomerKey** column header.

![Screenshot of expanding merged columns button on vDimCustomerKey](media/dataflow-expand-merged-column.png)

1. In the expand pane, deselect CustomerId, so CustomerKey and IsActive are selected. Select **OK**.
![Screenshot of expand merged columns pane for vDimCustomerKey](media/dataflow-expand-merged-column-pane.png)

1. Repeat steps 1-6 to merge **vw_Pos_Sales** with **vDimShopKey** on **ShopId**. Expand the merged columns to include only the ShopKey and IsActive columns from each view.

1. Your power query should now look like the following:

![Screenshot of Dataflow Power Query after merging DimCustomer and DimShop](media/dataflow-power-query-after-merge.png)

1. Select and highlight **vw_Pos_Sales**, then in the top menu ribbon select **Add Column** > **Index Column** > **From 1** from the dropdown to add another transformation step.

1. In the Custom Column pane, enter ++*MaxSalesKey*++ as the New column name.
1. Select **Whole Number** as the Data type.
1. In the Custom column formula box, enter the following formula to create a SalesKey based on the LocalIndex column:
+++*let
  t = dbo_vFactSalesMaxKey,
  v = if Table.RowCount(t) > 0
      then Record.Field(Table.First(t), "MaxSalesKey")
      else 0
