# Lab Overview

Fourth Coffee is a fictional specialty coffee retailer that has carved out a unique niche in the aviation industry by exclusively operating coffee shops within airports. The company has built its business model around serving travelers, airport staff, and aviation professionals who need quality coffee and quick service in fast-paced airport environments.

As Fourth Coffee continues to expand across different airports, the company faces unique challenges in understanding customer behavior patterns, managing inventory across distributed locations, and optimizing store placement within terminal layouts. The company leverages canonical airline and airport data alongside their operational metrics to make data-driven decisions about:

- **Strategic expansion**: Identifying which airports and terminal locations offer the best opportunities for new store openings
- **Personalized customer experiences**: Understanding traveler preferences and flight patterns to deliver targeted recommendations
- **Inventory optimization**: Managing stock levels across multiple airport locations with varying passenger traffic patterns
- **Real-time operations**: Responding quickly to flight delays, gate changes, and peak travel periods that impact customer flow

This lab demonstrates how Fourth Coffee uses Microsoft Fabric and Cosmos DB to unify their operational data with broader aviation analytics, enabling cross-database queries, real-time analytics, and AI-driven insights that power both strategic business decisions and personalized customer experiences.

In this 75 minute lab, you will step into the role of a data engineer for the Fourth Coffee Company, unifying operational data with analytical data in Microsoft Fabric. By the end of the lab you will have built an end to end solution that:

- **Ingests and stores operational data** in Cosmos DB in Microsoft Fabric
- **Runs a batch job** to load data from Cosmos DB into a Data Warehouse
- **Performs cross-database analytics** by joining operational data with curated relational data <!-- TODO: Determine if time allows for this step -->
- **Processes real-time POS events** using Fabric Eventstreams, storing them in Cosmos DB for operational access
- **Builds a personalization model** using Spark in Fabric Notebooks to generate customer recommendations
- **Implements "reverse ETL"** to push enriched insights back into Cosmos DB for low-latency serving to applications
- **(Optional) Serves personalized recommendations** from Cosmos DB through a frontend application

This lab contains 5 exercises, each with multiple steps. Complete all the steps in each exercise before moving on to the next one. The exercises are designed to be completed in sequence, building on the work from previous exercises.

1. **Fabric Environment Setup**: Automated setup of the Fabric items needed for the lab.
1. **Exercise 1**: Provisioning Cosmos DB in Fabric (Operational Data Store)
1. **Exercise 2**: Batch Data Loading and Cross-Database Analytics (Cosmos DB to Data Warehouse)
1. **Exercise 3**: Real-Time Streaming of POS Events
1. **Exercise 4**: Build Personalization Model and Implement Reverse ETL
1. **Exercise 5 (Optional)**: Serve Personalized Recommendations from Cosmos DB

Don't worry if you run out of time to complete the entire lab. All of these exercises available on [our repo](https://aka.ms/). <!--TODO: Add aka.ms link to repo-->

## Get Started

> [!TIP]
> As you follow the instructions in this pane, whenever you see a `icon`, you can use it to copy text from the instruction pane into the virtual machine interface. This is particularly useful to copy code; but bear in mind you may need to modify the pasted code to fix indent levels or formatting before running it!

## Sign into Windows

1. In the virtual machine, sign into Windows using the following credentials:

   - Username: `@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Username`
   - Password: `@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11-Pro-Base).Password`
